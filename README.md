## Inscribed Square 
[Inscribed square problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscribed_square_problem) is an open problem in mathematics. I tried to study the change in the coordinates of inscribed square for a curve with changes in the shape of the curve. This project tries to draw an inscribed square for a given curve with certain approximations. 

Though, it's already proven that inscribed square exists for polygons and the curves drawn here are polygons. 

### Usage
In terminal :
```
npm install
```
Open index.html in a browser and start drawing a curve.
